# The Best Free Things
If you're cheap like me, you want good free stuff. Here's a list of all my favorite good free things.

## Pictures
### Image Editing
Bitmap/Raster Graphics: [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html)

Vector Graphics: [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)

Both at Once: [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) *(It's like ambidextrious image editing, except not at all like that.)*


### Image Hosting
Clean interface with no ads (no account required): [Cubeupload](http://cubeupload.com/)

Professional-looking host with a few adds (needs account): [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/)

### Image Taking (screenshots)
In-browser or offline, automatic uploading: [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/)

Offline only, also takes animated GIFs: [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/) *(NOTE: I gained a virus soon after installing this. However, nobody else has had issues. Most likely safe, but be careful.)*

Windows-only, no automatic upload: [Snipping Tool](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-capture-screen-shots#1TC=windows-8) *(Most likely came with Windows)*
