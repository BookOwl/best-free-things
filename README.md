# The Best Free Things
If you're cheap like me, you want good free stuff. Here's a list of all my favorite good free things.

## Image Editing
**Bitmap/Raster Graphics:** [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html)

**Vector Graphics:** [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)

**Both at Once:** [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)
(It's like ambidextrious image editing, except not at all like that.)
